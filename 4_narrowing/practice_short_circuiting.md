```ts
type Vehicle =
  | {
      kind: "car";
      fuelType: "gas" | "electric";
      range: number;
    }
  | {
      type: "bicycle";
      isElectric: boolean;
    };

function getVehicleInfo(vehicle: Vehicle) {
  const info =
    (vehicle.kind === "car" &&
      `Car with ${vehicle.fuelType} engine and a range of ${vehicle.range} km`) ||
    (vehicle.type === "bicycle" &&
      `Bicycle with electric assist: ${vehicle.isElectric}`);
  console.log(info);
}

getVehicleInfo({ type: "bicycle", isElectric: true });
```

This code will result in a type error, as the passed in `vehicle` does not have the property `kind`. Because the type guard uses the logical AND operator, only the left operand is checked, which presents the error.
